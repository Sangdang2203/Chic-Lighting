    <h1 class="px-5">Chic Lighting's history</h1>
    <ol class="mx-4">
      <li> In 1901, the mercury vapor light using standard power was invented.</li>
      <li> In the early 1860s, fluorescent lights were invented. Thomas Edison developed the carbon filament
        incandescent light bulb in 1879, which became the standard of lighting for decades.</li>
      <li> In the early 1880s, direct current electricity scaled to citywide levels, followed by alternating
        current in the late 1880s.</li>
      <li> Chic Lighting & Design has its presence since 1971. We offer unique lighting and accessories from
        the most elegant traditional to refined contemporary for todayâ€™s eclectic interiors.</li>
